#Q1. The iris data-set is a built-in data-set in R that contains measurements on 4 
#different attributes (in centimeters) for 150 flowers from 3 different species. Load 
#this data-set and do the following: 
#(a) Print first few rows of this data-set. 
#(b) Find the structure of this data-set. 
#(c) Find the range of the data regarding the sepal length of flowers. 
#(d) Find the mean of the sepal length. 
#(e) Find the median of the sepal length. 
#(f) Find the first and the third quartiles and hence the interquartile range. 
#(g) Find the standard deviation and variance. 
#(h) Try doing the above exercises for sepal.width, petal.length and petal.width. 
#(i) Use the built-in function summary on the data-set Iris.

#Q2. R does not have a standard in-built function to calculate mode. So we 
#create a user function to calculate mode of a data set in R. This function 
#takes the vector as input and gives the mode value as output.
# Function to calculate the mode
calculate_mode <- function(x) {
  # Remove NA values
  x <- na.omit(x)
  # Get the unique values and their frequencies
  unique_values <- unique(x)
  frequencies <- table(x)#table uniquely count the value of vector 
  # Find the maximum frequency
  max_freq <- max(frequencies)
  # Get the values that have the maximum frequency (mode)
  modes <- unique_values[frequencies == max_freq]
  return(modes)
}
# Example usage
data_vector <- c(1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5)

#Q3. A room has M people, and each has an equal chance of being born on any of 
#the 365 days of the year. (For simplicity, we will ignore leap years). What is the 
#probability that two people in the room have the same birthday ? 
#(a) Use an R simulation to estimate this for various M. 
#(b) Find the smallest value of M for which the probability of a match is greater 
#than 0.5.
