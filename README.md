## Overview
This R program is designed to help users understand various statistical methods used to calculate different values, including measures of central tendency, dispersion, correlation, and hypothesis testing.

## Features
- Computes mean, median, and mode
- Calculates standard deviation and variance
- Performs correlation analysis
- Conducts hypothesis tests (t-tests, chi-square tests, etc.)
- Generates visual representations of statistical distributions
- Plots various types of graphs including histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and bar charts

## Prerequisites
- R (latest version recommended)
- RStudio (optional but recommended for better usability)

## Usage
1. Load the script into RStudio or execute it in an R environment.
2. Ensure the dataset is properly formatted before running statistical functions.
3. Run specific statistical analysis functions based on your needs.

## Example
```r
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# Sample dataset
data <- c(12, 15, 14, 10, 18, 20, 24, 22, 19, 17)

# Compute mean
mean_value <- mean(data)
print(paste("Mean:", mean_value))

# Histogram
ggplot(data.frame(x = data), aes(x)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2, fill = "blue", color = "black") +
  ggtitle("Histogram of Data")

# Box Plot
boxplot(data, main = "Boxplot of Data", col = "orange")

# Scatter Plot
x_vals <- 1:length(data)
ggplot(data.frame(x_vals, data), aes(x = x_vals, y = data)) +
  geom_point(color = "red") +
  ggtitle("Scatter Plot of Data") +
  xlab("Index") +
  ylab("Values")
```
